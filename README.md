Project: Iris Flower Classification API
This project provides a RESTful API for classifying iris flower species using a pre-trained logistic regression model. Built with FastAPI, it includes endpoints to make predictions based on sepal and petal measurements.

Project Structure:

fastapi_app.py: Main FastAPI app serving the model.
testing_fast_api.py: Script to test the API's prediction endpoint.
iris_logistic_regression.pkl: Serialized model file.
deploying_ml_models.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for deployment processes and insights (if applicable).
Additional Files
.gitignore: Excludes virtual environment folders, .pkl files, and any unnecessary system files.
requirements.txt: Lists dependencies (FastAPI, joblib, etc.).
README.md: Documents project purpose, setup, and usage instructions.
